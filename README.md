When applying for developer jobs, an applicant – such as myself – may be asked to conduct a coding challenge by the potential employer. Coding challenges take place on websites like CoderByte. In this instance, it was a coding challenge to be done in ReactJS. This is my code submitted to that challenge on Nov 6, 2022. Hopefully you find some use out of it!
