# CoderByte Phone Book App

When applying for developer jobs, an applicant – such as myself – maybe asked to conduct a coding challenge by the employer. Coding challenges take place on websites like CoderByte. In this instance it was a coding challenge to be done in ReactJS. This is my code submitted to that challenge. Hopefully you find some use out of it!
